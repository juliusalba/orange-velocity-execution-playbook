"Absolutely, this is a big decision. What specific questions do you have? Let's address them now while we're together."

**"YOUR PRICE IS TOO HIGH"**

Response:
"I understand budget is a concern. Let's look at this from an ROI perspective:

If we achieve a 4x ROAS (which is conservative based on our track record):
• Your PHP 100k ad spend becomes PHP 400k revenue
• Our PHP 25k fee is covered 4x over
• Your net profit: PHP 275k

Compare that to:
• Hiring in-house: PHP 40-60k/month salary + benefits + tools
• Cheaper agency: Might save PHP 10k/month but generate PHP 100k less revenue

Which makes more business sense?"

Alternative: "What budget did you have in mind? Let's see if we can create a package that works."

**"I NEED TO TALK TO MY PARTNER/TEAM"**

Response:
"Absolutely, this should be a team decision. A few questions to help that conversation:

1. What specific concerns do you think they'll have?
2. Would it help if I joined that conversation to answer questions directly?
3. When are you planning to discuss this with them?

In the meantime, I'll send over our case studies and some client testimonials - that might help with the discussion."

---

**"WE TRIED AN AGENCY BEFORE AND IT DIDN'T WORK"**

Response:
"I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, there are a lot of agencies that over-promise and under-deliver.

Can I ask:
• What specifically didn't work?
• What were they doing (or not doing)?
• What would you want to be different this time?

Here's how we're different:
1. [Specific differentiator #1]
2. [Specific differentiator #2]
3. [Specific differentiator #3]

Plus, we have a [performance guarantee/trial period] so you're not locked in if we don't deliver."

---

**"WE DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW"**

Response:
"I totally get it - timing is important. A few questions:

1. When do you anticipate having budget available?
2. What would need to happen between now and then?
3. Would starting with a smaller test budget (PHP 30-50k) make sense to prove ROI first?

We could also structure it so you start small, and as we generate results, we reinvest profits into scaling. Would that work better?"

---

**"I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT"**

Response:
"Of course! This is a big decision. To help you think through it, what specific questions or concerns do you have?

[Let them answer, then address each one]

Is there anything else holding you back? I want to make sure you have everything you need to make the right decision.

How about this: Let's schedule a follow-up call for [3-5 days from now]. That gives you time to think, and we can address any remaining questions. Sound good?"

---

**"CAN YOU GUARANTEE RESULTS?"**

Response:
"Great question. Here's my honest answer:

No one can guarantee specific results in paid ads because there are variables outside our control (your product, market, competition, etc.).

However, I CAN guarantee:
✅ We'll follow our proven process that's worked for [X] clients
✅ You'll get complete transparency with weekly reports
✅ If we're not hitting benchmarks by month 2, we'll pivot strategy or part ways

What I can't do is guarantee a specific ROAS because that would be dishonest.

What I CAN say is: We've achieved [X] average ROAS for [similar clients], and I'm confident we can do the same for you.

Does that make sense?"
