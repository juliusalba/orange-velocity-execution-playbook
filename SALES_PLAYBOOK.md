# SALES PLAYBOOK: ICP #1 - E-commerce Growth-Stage

## Phase 1: Initial Outreach (Days 1-3)

### LinkedIn Outreach Template

**Message 1 (Connection Request):**
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed you're the founder of [Company] - impressive what you've built in the [industry] space!

I work with e-commerce founders in the Philippines to reduce their CAC and scale their ads profitably. We recently helped a fashion brand go from PHP 400 CAC to PHP 180 CAC in 60 days.

Would be great to connect and share some insights from the Philippine market.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - No sales pitch, just founder-to-founder conversation 😊
```

**Send 50 of these per day to e-commerce founders.**

**Message 2 (After Connection - Day 2):**
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Quick question - are you currently running Facebook/Instagram ads for [Company]? And if so, how's your CAC trending over the past few months?

We've been seeing a lot of e-commerce brands struggle with rising CAC lately, and I thought you might be experiencing something similar.

Would love to share some insights if you're interested.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Message 3 (If No Response After 5 Days):**
```
Hi [First Name],

I know you're busy building [Company], so I'll keep this brief.

I created a free guide called "5 Ways to Reduce Your CAC by 30% in 60 Days" specifically for Philippine e-commerce brands.

Would this be helpful for your business? If so, I can send it over.

Otherwise, no worries - keep up the great work with [Company]!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Email Outreach Template

**Subject Lines (A/B test these):**
- "Quick question about [Company]'s ads"
- "Reducing CAC for e-commerce brands in PH"
- "Insights from working with 50+ PH e-commerce brands"
- "Case study: From PHP 400 to PHP 180 CAC"

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s ads

Hi [First Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I work with e-commerce founders in the Philippines to solve their biggest challenge: rising customer acquisition costs.

In fact, I just wrapped up a campaign with a fashion brand in Manila where we reduced their CAC from PHP 400 to PHP 180 in 60 days while increasing their ROAS from 2.1x to 4.8x.

I came across [Company] and was impressed by your growth in the [industry] space.

Quick question: Is CAC a challenge for your business right now? If so, I'd love to share some insights from the Philippine market.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Orange Velocity
[Phone Number]

P.S. - If you're not dealing with CAC challenges right now, ignore this email. Just wanted to reach out in case you were.
```

### Cold Calling Script (If You Have Phone Number)

# SALES PLAYBOOK: ICP #2 - SaaS Scale-Up

## Key Differences from E-commerce

**Longer Sales Cycle (21-30 days)**
**Higher Decision Authority (CMO/CEO)**
**More Analytical (data-driven)**
**Longer Contracts (12-24 months)**

## Outreach Differences

### LinkedIn Message Template
```
Hi [First Name],

Noticed you're CMO at [Company] - congratulations on [recent achievement/news].

I work with SaaS CMOs to reduce CAC and improve funnel conversion. Recently helped a FinTech SaaS reduce CAC from PHP 12,000 to PHP 7,500 while increasing MRR by 40%.

Worth a conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Discovery Call Focus Areas

**BANT Questions:**
1. **Budget:** "What's your current CAC?" "What would reducing it by 30% mean?"
2. **Authority:** "Who else is involved in this decision?"
3. **Need:** "What's your biggest growth bottleneck right now?"
4. **Timeline:** "When do you need to see improvements?"

**SaaS-Specific Questions:**
```
1. "What's your average customer LTV?"
2. "What's your sales cycle length?"
3. "How do you currently track ROAS across platforms?"
4. "What percentage of leads come from paid ads?"
5. "Have you considered account-based marketing (ABM)?"

```

**Pain Points to Emphasize:**
- **High CAC** (long payback period)
- **Attribution challenges** (multiple touchpoints)
- **Scaling paid acquisition** (losing efficiency at scale)
- **Investor pressure** (need to prove ROI)

### SaaS Strategy Session

**Focus Areas:**
1. **Attribution modeling** (how to track ROAS properly)
2. **Funnel optimization** (ad → landing → demo → trial → paid)
3. **Lead quality improvement** (ABM, intent data)
4. **Creative testing** (video ads, case studies, demos)

## Objection Handling Mastery

### Objection: "We tried an agency before and it didn't work"
**Response:**
```
"I understand - and that's actually why we do things differently. Most agencies take a one-size-fits-all approach.

We spend the first 30 days doing a deep audit and creating a custom strategy for YOUR business. Then we test systematically and iterate based on data.

Can I ask - what specifically didn't work with the previous agency?"
```

### Objection: "Your price is too high"
**Response:**
```
"I appreciate you being upfront about that. Help me understand - when you say it's too high, are you comparing it to other agencies, or is it just not in your budget right now?

[IF BUDGET]: What budget were you working with?
[IF COMPARISON]: Here's what you get for that investment: [show deliverables + ROI]

You know, price is what you pay, value is what you get. If we can reduce your CAC by 30%, what would that be worth to your business?"
```

### Objection: "We need to think about it"
**Response:**
```
"Of course - this is an important decision. What specifically would you like to think about? Is it the investment, the timing, the strategy, or something else?

[LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERN]

Can I address that concern?

Also, given that [upcoming event] is coming up, I'd hate for you to miss the opportunity to be ready for that. How about we schedule a quick 10-minute call in 2 days to address any questions?"
```

### Objection: "We're happy with our current results"
**Response:**
```
"That's great! I'm curious though - what would taking your current results to the next level mean for your business? Are you looking to scale, or are you pretty happy where you are?

[LISTEN]

You know, even if we're happy where we are, it's smart to at least explore options. What if there was a way to get better results with the same ad spend? Would that be worth a conversation?"
```
