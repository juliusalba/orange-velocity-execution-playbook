**Message 1: Connection Request**
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed you're the founder of [Company] - impressive what you've built in the [industry] space!

I work with e-commerce founders in the Philippines to reduce their CAC and scale their ads profitably. We recently helped a [fashion/beauty/home] brand go from PHP 400 CAC to PHP 180 CAC in 60 days.

Would be great to connect and share some insights from the Philippine market.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - No sales pitch, just founder-to-founder conversation 😊

Hi [First Name],

### Sequence B: Email Outreach (7 emails over 21 days)

**Email 1: Initial Outreach**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s ads

Hi [First Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I work with e-commerce founders in the Philippines to solve their biggest challenge: rising customer acquisition costs.

In fact, I just wrapped up a campaign with a fashion brand in Manila where we reduced their CAC from PHP 400 to PHP 180 in 60 days while increasing their ROAS from 2.1x to 4.8x.

I came across [Company] and was impressed by your growth in the [industry] space.

Quick question: Is CAC a challenge for your business right now? If so, I'd love to share some insights from the Philippine market.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**Email 2: Case Study (Day 3)**
```
Subject: Case study: How [Brand] reduced CAC by 53%

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up with a quick case study that might interest you.

[Client Name] is a [industry] e-commerce brand here in Manila. When we started working together 90 days ago, they were struggling with:
• High CAC (PHP 420)
• Inconsistent ROAS (ranging from 1.5x to 3.0x)
• Difficulty scaling beyond PHP 200k/month ad spend

Here's what we achieved in 90 days:
✅ Reduced CAC to PHP 195 (53% reduction)
✅ Increased ROAS to 4.8x (consistent)
✅ Scaled ad spend to PHP 500k/month
✅ Generated PHP 2.4M additional revenue

The full case study: [link]

The key insight: We shifted from broad targeting to highly specific custom audiences based on their existing customer data.

Curious - could this approach work for [Company]?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 3: Educational Content (Day 7)**
```
Subject: The biggest e-commerce ad mistake (and how to fix it)

Hi [First Name],

I hope you're having a great week.

I wanted to share something I've noticed working with 50+ e-commerce brands in the Philippines:

**The #1 Mistake: Using the same ad creative for more than 2-3 weeks**

Most brands create 5-10 ad creatives, test them, find winners, then just keep running those winners.

Problem: Ad fatigue sets in fast, especially on Facebook/Instagram.

Our clients see 40-60% decline in performance after 3 weeks with the same creative.

**The Fix: Creative Refresh System**
Week 1-2: Launch 10 new creatives
Week 3: Analyze performance
Week 4: Create 5 new creatives based on winners
Week 5-6: Test new set
Week 7: Repeat

This keeps performance stable and actually improving over time.

Does this match what you're seeing with [Company]'s ads?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 4: Objection Handling (Day 11)**
```
Subject: "We tried an agency before..." (3 things we do differently)

Hi [First Name],

I often hear from e-commerce founders:

"We've tried working with an agency before and it didn't work."

Common reasons it fails:
1. One-size-fits-all approach (no customization)
2. No clear strategy (just "run ads")
3. Poor communication (you're left in the dark)

Here's what we do differently:

**#1: Custom Strategy for YOUR Business**
We spend 2 weeks auditing your market, competitors, and current ads before creating a custom strategy. No templates.

**#2: Proven 4-Step System**
We've refined this system across 50+ campaigns:
1. Audience segmentation
2. Creative testing framework
3. Optimization schedule
4. Scaling methodology

**#3: Transparent Communication**
• Weekly reports (every Monday)
• Real-time dashboard access
• Bi-weekly strategy calls
• Direct access to your strategist

We also guarantee results: If we don't reduce your CAC by 20% in 60 days, we work for free until we do.

Has this been your experience with other agencies?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 5: Social Proof (Day 15)**
```
Subject: Client testimonial video (2 min watch)

Hi [First Name],

Hope you're having a good week.

I wanted to share this quick video testimonial from one of our clients.

[Client Name] - Founder of [Company] (they said I could share this):

[VIDEO EMBED OR LINK]

Key quote: "We went from barely breaking even on ads to PHP 2M additional revenue in 6 months. Orange Velocity literally transformed our business."

[Client Name] is now spending PHP 600k/month on ads with an average ROAS of 5.2x.

Would you be interested in achieving similar results for [Company]?

Best,
[Your Name]

**Email 6: Soft Pitch (Day 19)**

## ICP #2: SaaS Scale-Up

### LinkedIn Sequence (6 messages over 18 days)

**Message 1: Connection Request**
```
Hi [First Name],

Congrats on [recent achievement - funding, product launch, etc.]. Impressive progress at [Company].

I work with SaaS CMOs to reduce CAC and improve funnel conversion. Recently helped a FinTech SaaS reduce CAC from PHP 12,000 to PHP 7,500 while increasing MRR by 40%.

Would love to connect and share some insights from the Philippine SaaS market.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Message 2: SaaS Pain Points (Day 3)**
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Quick question - what's your biggest growth bottleneck at [Company] right now?

Common challenges we see with SaaS companies:
• High CAC in competitive markets
• Long sales cycles (60-90 days)
• Difficulty proving ROI to investors
• Attribution across multiple touchpoints

Sound familiar?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Message 3: SaaS Case Study (Day 6)**
```
Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share a quick case study:

[Client Name] - B2B SaaS (HR platform)
Challenge: CAC was PHP 15,000, payback period was 8 months
Solution: Implemented account-based marketing + attribution modeling
Result in 90 days:
• CAC reduced to PHP 8,500
• Payback period: 4 months
• MRR increased by PHP 1.2M
• Conversion rate improved from 3% to 6%

The game-changer was proper attribution across all touchpoints.

Full case study: [link]

Could this approach work for [Company]?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Message 4: SaaS Content (Day 10)**
```
Hi [First Name],

I created a free guide: "The SaaS CMO's Guide to Reducing CAC by 40%"

Includes:
✓ How to build high-converting SaaS ad funnels
✓ Attribution modeling for long sales cycles
✓ Creative strategies for B2B SaaS
✓ Case studies from 5 successful SaaS companies

Would this be helpful for your work at [Company]?

If so, I'll send it over.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Message 5: ROI Focus (Day 14)**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: What's your current CAC at [Company]? And what's your target?

I ask because we recently worked with a SaaS company where we:
• Reduced CAC from PHP 14k to PHP 8k
• Improved conversion rate from 4% to 9%
• Increased demo bookings by 60%
• Reduced cost per demo from PHP 2,100 to PHP 890

When I asked their CMO what that was worth, they said: "Everything. We're now profitable on paid acquisition for the first time."

If reducing your CAC by 40-50% would be valuable for [Company], I'd love to share how we did it.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Message 6: Final (Day 18)**
```
Hi [First Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume now isn't the right time for [Company].

No problem at all!

I'll check back in 3 months to see how things are progressing.

Best of luck with [Company]!

## ICP #3: Traditional Business Going Digital

### Email Sequence (5 emails over 25 days)

**Email 1: Understanding & Empathy**
```
Subject: Helping [Industry] businesses go digital

Hi [First Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I noticed [Company] has been serving [location] for [X] years. That's impressive commitment to your community.

With more customers moving online (especially after the past few years), I'm helping traditional [industry] businesses expand into digital channels.

Recently helped a [similar business] go from zero online presence to generating PHP 200k/month in online sales within 6 months.

They told me: "I wish I had done this sooner. It's opened up a whole new customer base for us."

Is [Company] considering expanding online, or are you happy with your current setup?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Orange Velocity

**Email 2: Success Story (Day 5)**
```
Subject: How [Local Business] grew 300% with digital ads

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share a story that might interest you.

[Client Name] owns a [similar business] in [nearby city]. Like many traditional businesses, they were skeptical about digital marketing.

But in 6 months:
• Generated 150+ new customers online
• Increased monthly revenue by PHP 180k
• Expanded from [location] to serving [area]
• Built a waiting list of 50+ customers

The key was starting small: PHP 10k/month ad budget, focusing on one service, and proving results before scaling.

Full story: [link]

Is [Company] in a position to explore digital expansion?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 3: Education (Day 10)**
```
Subject: The biggest myth about digital ads (for traditional businesses)

Hi [First Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I hear this often from traditional business owners:

"Our customers are older - they don't use the internet."

Here's the truth: 73% of consumers aged 55+ research businesses online before visiting.

Your customers ARE using the internet - they're just finding your competitors instead of you.

**The Fix:**
• Simple Google Ads for "near me" searches
• Facebook ads targeting your local area
• Google My Business optimization

We recently helped a [business type] in [city] get found online by 200+ new customers in their first month.

Would this make sense for [Company]?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 4: Soft Offer (Day 18)**
```
Subject: Free consultation for [Company]

Hi [First Name],

I know you're busy, so I'll be brief.

Given your business and the market shift online, would you be interested in a free 30-minute consultation?

I'll share:
• How [Company] can compete online
• What digital marketing would look like for your business
• Realistic expectations for results and timeline

No pitch, no obligation - just insights that could help [Company] grow.

Interested? Just reply "Yes" and we'll schedule a call.

Best,

**Email 5: Final Follow-up (Day 25)**
```
Subject: Last note about digital growth for [Company]

Hi [First Name],

This will be my last email about digital marketing for [Company].

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming either:
• You're not interested in digital marketing
• You're busy with other priorities
• You already have a solution

All completely understandable.

I'll check back in 6 months to see if things have changed.

In the meantime, best of luck with [Company]!

### Email 1: Welcome & Value
```
Subject: Welcome! Here's what to expect

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for your interest in working with Orange Velocity!

Since you're here, I'll assume you're looking to:
• Reduce your customer acquisition cost (CAC)
• Increase your return on ad spend (ROAS)
• Scale your ad spend profitably

Over the next 2 weeks, I'll send you:
✓ Case studies from similar businesses
✓ Free resources (guides, checklists)
✓ Behind-the-scenes insights
✓ Special offers (when available)

But mostly, I want to provide value that helps your business grow.

### Email 2: Case Study (Day 3)
```
Subject: Case study: PHP 2.4M revenue increase

Hi [First Name],

Hope you're having a great week.

I wanted to share a case study that might interest you.

[Client Name] - Fashion E-commerce
Challenge: High CAC (PHP 420), inconsistent ROAS (1.5-3.0x)
Timeline: 90 days

Here's what we achieved:
✅ CAC reduced to PHP 195 (53% reduction)
✅ ROAS increased to 4.8x (consistent)
✅ Scaled ad spend: PHP 200k → PHP 500k/month
✅ Additional revenue: PHP 2.4M in 90 days

The full case study: [link]

Key insight: We shifted from demographic targeting to behavioral targeting based on customer purchase history.

Does this align with challenges you're facing?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Email 3: Educational Content (Day 7)
```
Subject: The most important ad metric (most people ignore this)

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: What's your most important ad metric?

Most people say: "ROAS" or "CPA"

But the REAL most important metric is something else entirely:

**Time to Break-Even**

Here's why:
ROAS tells you: Revenue ÷ Spend
Break-even tells you: When you'll recover your investment

Example:
Campaign A: 2.0x ROAS, break-even in 45 days
Campaign B: 3.0x ROAS, break-even in 90 days

Campaign A is actually better because your cash flows faster.

We use break-even analysis for all our clients to optimize for cash flow, not just revenue.

Does this make sense for [Company]'s business?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Email 4: Social Proof (Day 11)
