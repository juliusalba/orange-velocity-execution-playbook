# PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

- ROI calculation: "If we increase your revenue by PHP 500k/month, PHP 28k is 5.6%"

### Good-Better-Best
- **Starter:** Good (basic needs)
- **Growth:** Better (most popular)
- **Enterprise:** Best (comprehensive)

### Scarcity
- "We only take 10 clients per month"
- "Enterprise tier has 3 spots available"
- "Growth tier waitlist is 2 weeks"

### Risk Reversal
- Guarantees at every tier
- Shorter contracts for Starter
- Proof of concept approach

# OBJECTION HANDLING

## "Your price is too high"

### Response Strategy
```
"I appreciate you being upfront about that. Help me understand - are you comparing us to other agencies, or is it just not in your budget right now?

[IF BUDGET]: What budget were you working with?
[IF COMPARISON]: Here's what makes us different: [list value props]

Let me show you the math:
Current: You're spending PHP XXX,XXX/month on ads with X.Xx ROAS
After: You'll spend PHP XXX,XXX/month with X.Xx ROAS
Impact: PHP XXX,XXX additional revenue per month
Our Fee: PHP XX,XXX/month
Net Impact: PHP XXX,XXX additional profit

Price is what you pay, value is what you get. In this case, you're getting XX% ROI on our investment.

Does that help put it in perspective?"
```

## "We're happy with our current results"

### Response Strategy
```
"That's great to hear! I'm curious though - what would taking your current results to the next level mean for your business?

[LISTEN]

You know, even when things are going well, there's usually room for improvement. What if we could:
- Reduce your CPA by 30%
- Increase your ROAS by 50%
- Scale your ad spend from PHP XXX,XXX to PHP XXX,XXX
- Free up your time to focus on other areas

Would that be worth a conversation?

Here's what I'd suggest: Let's do a free 30-day audit. We'll review your current campaigns, identify 3-5 quick wins, and show you exactly what we would do differently.

At the end of 30 days, you decide whether to move forward. No pressure, no obligation.

How does that sound?"
```

## "We need to think about it"

### Response Strategy
```
"Of course - this is an important decision. I want to make sure you have all the information you need.

What specifically would you like to think about? Is it the investment, the strategy, the timeline, or something else?

[LISTEN AND ADDRESS SPECIFIC CONCERN]

Can I share one more thing? Given that [upcoming event/season] is coming up, I'd hate for you to miss the opportunity to be ready for that.

If we start now, we'll have [X] weeks to optimize before [event]. If we wait, we'll be starting from scratch right when you need results most.

How about this: I can hold a spot for you for 48 hours while you think it over. If you decide to move forward, we'll lock in the current pricing. If not, no worries at all.

Fair enough?"
```
